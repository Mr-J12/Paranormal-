    <h1>Asmoday</h1>
<h3>Origin:</h3>
<p>
Asmoday, also known by various names such as Asmodai, Ashmodai, and Asmodeus, was once a splendid angel of knowledge and order. However, his curiosity and ambition for power led him to directly challenge celestial authorities, seeking to rewrite the destiny of all that exists. This audacity condemned him to be banished, and in his fall, Asmoday dragged countless lesser angels with him, forming his own infernal legion.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Characteristics:</h3>
<p>
The Great King Asmoday adopts a truly terrifying appearance: three distinct heads - bull, man, and ram - with flames escaping from his mouths and a serpentine tail. His webbed feet, like those of a goose, further distinguish him. He perches on an infernal dragon, carrying a lance that waves a dark banner. This demon is a master of arts such as arithmetic, astronomy, and geometry, and can grant humans temporary invincibility.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Dominion:</h3>
<p>
Asmoday wields power over hidden knowledge and wisdom, allowing those who pact with him to access secrets of the cosmos. Furthermore, he has the ability to reveal hidden treasures and safeguard them. He is skilled in manipulating flames and can influence the human mind to plunge into the thirst for power and knowledge.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Legions:</h3>
<p>
Under the authority of AMAYMON, Asmoday commands 72 legions of lesser spirits, each specialized in different aspects of malevolence and cunning.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Prophecies:</h3>
<p>
There is an ancient myth that says at the moment when all the treasures of the world are revealed, Asmoday will lead his legions in a final battle against the heavens, seeking to reclaim his position and rewrite the destiny of the cosmos.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Invocation:</h3>
<p>
Those who wish to invoke Asmoday yearn for knowledge, power, and riches. To invoke him, it is essential to trace his symbol on clay ground, light three black candles, and recite:

''Asmoday, Great King of the Abyss, reveal your secrets and grant your power''.

In return, the demon may demand eternal loyalty or forbidden knowledge possessed by the summoner.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Protection:</h3>
<p>
Entering into a pact with Asmoday is not without consequences. The thirst for power and knowledge can corrupt summoners, leading them to their own downfall. To protect oneself, it is advisable to carry a black onyx amulet and recite protection prayers at dawn and dusk. In case of feeling trapped by his influence, seeking the guidance of an experienced exorcist is essential.
