    <h1>Ashtaroth</h1>
<h3>Origin:</h3>
<p>
Before his fall, Astaroth was an angel of wisdom and enlightenment, with a deep connection to the mysteries of the cosmos. His boundless ambition and thirst for knowledge led him to question and challenge divine providence. Over time, he believed he could transcend and even surpass his Creator. This pride led him to lead a group of angels in a rebellion that failed miserably. For his betrayal, he was banished to the infernal abyss.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Characteristics:</h3>
<p>
Astaroth appears as a terrifying angel, riding a dragon-like beast and wielding a viper in his right hand. This manifestation symbolizes both his fallen nature and his connection to forbidden knowledge. His breath is poisonous, emanating an air that can harm or drive those nearby to madness. However, he is a great repository of wisdom and can reveal truths of the past, present, and future.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Dominion:</h3>
<p>
He presides over the acquisition of hidden and esoteric knowledge. He can influence the thoughts and desires of humans, pushing them toward the insatiable pursuit of wisdom and understanding, even if it entails danger or condemnation.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Legions:</h3>
<p>
He rules over 40 legions of infernal spirits, many of whom specialize in magic, divination, and occult sciences. Through these legions, Astaroth can extend his influence across many realms and planes, with hell being his primary domain.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Prophecies:</h3>
<p>
There is an ancient myth that predicts that Astaroth, in his eternal quest for knowledge, will finally discover a secret that threatens the very existence of the cosmos. This discovery would trigger a cataclysm where reality itself could be torn asunder.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Invocation:</h3>
<p>
Invoking Astaroth will grant knowledge and hidden secrets, allowing summoners to master sciences and arts previously unknown to them. To invoke him, his symbol must be traced in a pentacle, and one must recite:

''Astaroth, bearer of forbidden knowledge, come to me and reveal the secrets of the cosmos''.

In return for his favor, Astaroth will demand tribute in the form of an object or cherished memory from the summoner.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Protection:</h3>
<p>
The knowledge granted by Astaroth can be both a blessing and a curse, as it can lead to madness or isolation. To protect oneself from his toxic influence, it is advisable to wear a magical ring, which, when placed near the face, can repel his poisonous breath. Additionally, prayers of purity and centered meditations can help maintain mental clarity and resist his seductions.
