    <h1>Belial</h1>
<h3>Origin:</h3>
<p>
Belial, whose name resonates like an echo of decadence, was one of the most virtuous and brilliant angels created after Lucifer. His beauty was such that it seemed to eclipse other celestial beings. However, his pride and desire for recognition led him to conspire against the higher designs. It was he who, along with Lucifer, led the celestial uprising, believing that his position and light were greater than any other. Due to such arrogance, he was banished, falling from the celestial heights to the abyssal depths of hell.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Characteristics:</h3>
<p>
Belial manifests as two angels of dazzling beauty, seated in a fiery chariot, a vision of power and majesty. His voice, seductive and clear, can persuade even the firmest of hearts. But his beauty is deceptive; behind it lies a cunning and manipulative mind. He is capable of granting wealth, power, and prestigious positions to those who seek him.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Characteristics:</h3>
<p>
He is the lord of manipulation, ambition, and betrayal. He delights in inciting mortals to acts of selfishness, persuading them to betray their loved ones for power and recognition. His influence is most strongly felt in courts and palaces, where the desires for power are strongest.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Characteristics:</h3>
<p>
He commands 50 legions of spirits, each reflecting a facet of his twisted nature. They specialize in deception, manipulation, and betrayal, infiltrating the minds of mortals and whispering promises of greatness.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Prophecies:</h3>
<p>
It is said that on the day of the final judgment, Belial will lead his legions in a final battle against the celestial hosts, attempting to reclaim his lost place in the celestial realm. Legends speak of a cataclysm where the world will be divided between light and darkness.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Invocation:</h3>
<p>
By invoking Belial, one can gain wealth, influence, and power, but at a high price. To summon him, one must draw his symbol on the ground and recite:

''Oh Belial, fallen angel of splendor, grant me your favor, and I will offer you what you desire''.

However, this demon demands offerings, sacrifices, and gifts before granting any favor. The summoner must present a valuable tribute, such as an ancestral relic or an object of great sentimental value.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Protection:</h3>
<p>
Dealing with Belial is dancing with deceit. Although he will grant what is promised, his price is often treacherous. He may demand acts of betrayal or require unthinkable sacrifices. Protecting oneself from him requires an amulet blessed with holy water and salt, which must be carried at all times. If someone feels his influence, they must seek redemption through acts of kindness and humility, rejecting the excessive ambition that Belial instigates.
