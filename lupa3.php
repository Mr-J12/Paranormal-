    <h1>Gaap</h1>
<h3>Origin:</h3>
<p>
Gaap, also known as Tap or Goap, was once an angel of the Order of the Potentates, who served as guardians of divine knowledge. His rebellion arose from his insatiable desire to release that knowledge, believing that the truth should be known by all. This bold decision led him to fall from the celestial realm, where the struggle for freedom of information became his eternal curse.

</p>
<br>
<h3>Characteristics:</h3>
<p>
Despite his divine stature, Gaap prefers to manifest in human form. He is often seen leading the Four Great Demonic Kings, acting as a guide. He possesses the power to cloud the minds of humans, making them ignorant, or enlighten them in arts and sciences. He is a master manipulator of love and hate.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Dominion:</h3>
<p>
Gaap specializes in revealing and concealing knowledge. He can transform an ignorant person into a sage or a wise person into a fool. His dominion also extends to the manipulation of human emotions and feelings, from purest love to deepest hatred. Additionally, he can transport souls between realms with supernatural speed.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Legions:</h3>
<p>
Under the dominion of AMAYMON, Gaap commands 66 legions of lesser spirits. These entities are specialists in interplanar transportation and the revelation of secrets.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Legions:</h3>
<p>
It is said that when humanity is on the brink of its destruction due to ignorance and hatred, Gaap will emerge, not as a destroyer, but as a savior, offering knowledge to those willing to seek and understand it.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Invocation:</h3>
<p>
Gaap offers the gift of knowledge and the power of transportation between realms. To invoke him, one must draw his symbol on a silver tablet on a moonless night and recite:

''Gaap, Bearer of Secrets, Guide of Kings, reveal the hidden truth and take me where I desire''.

In return, Gaap may demand a sacrifice of personal knowledge or even a precious memory from the summoner.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Protection:</h3>
<p>
Ignorance is often a blessing. Those who seek Gaap may find themselves overwhelmed by the truth. To protect oneself from his influences, one should carry a black tourmaline talisman and recite protection mantras at dusk and dawn. In cases of extreme need, seeking the intervention of a guardian of ancient knowledge is essential.</p>
